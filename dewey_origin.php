<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>
	Uganda is located in the heart of Africa. It is home to 42 million people and the population is growing at an average of 3.7% per year (as of 2018). That means you should all expect more Ugandan babies in the upcoming years. Uganda is blessed with abundant sun, freshwater & a rich cultural diversity of people. We are home to 56 traditional tribes which all have respective languages, dances, cultural clothing & values. Despite the diversity, the people all thrive in unison. Uganda is known for its rich wildlife (including lions, giraffes, buffalos, crocodiles, hippopotamuses, etc), rich bird diversity and fresh-water lakes including Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa - mother to River Nile that is shared with Tanzania & Kenya. Uganda is a peaceful country that is vibrant with opportunity for growth habiting a people that treasure and preserve nature.
