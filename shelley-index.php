		<p>I am specialized in entrepreneurship, impact investing and finance. In the past year, I led MBA teams and undergraduate teams to compete in various business competitions including Tibetan Innovation challenge, Hult Prize and New York Business Plan competition. This past summer I interned for a fintech company "MoneyMatch" to come up with a SEO strategy to improve their website's google organic listing and came up with content for their social media channels. I also worked for a venture capital firm in Kuala Lumpur where I streamlined deal-sourcing and worked with entrepreneurs help them achieve their goals.
