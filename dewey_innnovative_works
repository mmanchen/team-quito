<p>

I take pleasure in starting and managing companies. So far, I have two companies legally registered and undergoing development. One is a non-profit entity aimed at empowering young people in my home country and another is a for-profit e-commerce entity in the construction & infrastructure industry. A lot more will be started as long as I am alive. I have attempted many startups in the travel & environmental sustainability industries. As time progresses, I hope to startup & co-found companies in the Robotics, Real Estate, Energy, Agriculture & Logistics industries. The hope is that these companies will get to improve the lives of our humanity and delegate the profit to the right reasons that advance a civilization in the appropriate direction.
