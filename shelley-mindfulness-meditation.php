		<h1> Yoga and Meditation </h1>

		<p>The mindfulness community on campus has been a big support of my practice. Last May, I went on a meditation retreat at the Rochester Zen Center. It was very refreshing to see the beautiful architecture and the art work. Being at a beautiful place made my practice very special. It was so important to get fresh perspectives on meditation and have a beginnerâ€™s mind. I enjoyed having a community of people around me to support my practice. I sat in a circle of people who I just met but I felt like I have known them for years because meditation has brought us together. I particularly liked the small yoga movements that we did to unwind. It brought awareness to certain parts of my body that I usually do not pay attention to. I had many thoughts about planning out my weekend and getting more work done, but I realized it was not helping my practice. Instead of getting ahead of the present moment, I brought my attention back to my breath. We practiced walking meditation outside and I felt close to the nature and my inner- being. It was a reset button for me to get rejuvenated for a productive week.One of the most helpful part of the course was learning about how to expand my compassion and communicate with empathy.
