		<p>I am an international student from Uganda, East Africa currently studying in the United States. My belief in education to make a positive change has always been a driving factor in my academics, work and travel. My hope is that to learn the necessary skills in computer science, finance and management to lead organizations and companies that will make a fundamental change in our world. We are becoming a more interconnected world thanks to technology, common language and easier transportation mechanisms. This gives me optimism as we can always work holistically as humans to advance in technology, protect our environment for future generations and lead a new era of sustainable prosperity.
